/**
 * Find the longest increasing subsequence of a given sequence / array.
 * 
 * In other words, find a subsequence of array in which the subsequenceâ€™s
 * elements are in strictly increasing order, and in which the subsequence is
 * as long as possible. This subsequence is not necessarily contiguous, or
 * unique. In this case, we only care about the length of the longest increasing
 * subsequence.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array.
 * Space complexity: O(N).
 *
 * Explanation: start at the end of the array. The last element is our base
 * case and has subsequence size of 1. The element next to it will have
 * subsequence size 1 or 2, 2 if it is smaller than the last element. We,
 * continue this process and at each element we are we can not just check the
 * element at its right, but all the elements to its right to the end of the
 * array. For that particular element the longest subsequence will be 1 plus
 * the largest size already calculated for elements at its right that are bigger
 * than it.
