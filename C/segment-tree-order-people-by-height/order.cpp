/**
 * You are given the following:
 * A positive number N
 * Heights: A list of heights of N persons standing in a queue
 * Infronts: A list of numbers corresponding to each person (P) that gives the
 * number of persons who are taller than P and standing in front of P
 * 
 * You need to return list of actual order of personsâ€™s height
 * 
 * Note: consider that heights will be unique.
 *
 * Time complexity:
 *
 * Explanation: what is the place for the smallest person in the queue? To find
 * that we just need to count the number of people in front of him starting at
 * the very beginning of the array. And for the second smallest person? Again,
 * it is the number of people in front of him counted from the very beginning
 * of the array, but this time we need to realize that we should just count free
 * spots remaining in our answer. So if in our count we fall into a position
 * where the first smallest person was placed we don't take it into account.
 *
 * Based on that, we just need to sort our array of heights and do the process
 * described above. The sorting process give us a O(logN) time complexity,
 * where N is the number of elements in the array.
 *
 * Now, can we do something to improve our code? Yes, we can. When we are
 * counting free spots to find out where our element should be placed in our
 * answer we take O(N) time, but if we use a segment tree we can find this spot
 * in O(logN) time. So, that is what we do. We build a segment tree with
 * information about free spots in our answer.
