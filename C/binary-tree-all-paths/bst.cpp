/**
 * Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each pathâ€™s
 * sum is equal to the given sum.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes.
 *
 * Explanation: first we need to think how we know we are at the end of a path
 * and that is accomplished checking if both children of a node are NULL.
 * Second, we need to traverse all the paths and we gonna use recursion for
 * that. I choose to first go to the left branch and after to the right branch.
 * At each node we visit we store it in a vector that we use to store our path.
 * We, then, keep a variable of the remaining sum when adding that node to the
 * path (remainingSum = sum - node->val) and call the function for the left
 * and right branchs with remainingSum as input of these calls.
 * If we reach a leaf node (both children NULL) we store out path in another
 * vector that stores all our paths (so it is a vector of vectors).
 * When we come back from both of our calls (left and right branch) we pop the
 * node we stored in our vector path at that call. Notice we don't pop our nodes
 * after the left branch call, but after the right branch call (or in another
 * words after both of the calls). This is because the right path can
 * potentially use nodes stored by the left branch calls.
