/**
 * Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodesâ€™ values.
 * (ie, from left to right, level by level).
 * 
 * Example :
 * Given binary tree,
 *     3
 *    / \
 *   9  20
 *     /  \
 *    15   7
 * return its level order traversal as:
 * [
 *   [3],
 *   [9,20],
 *   [15,7]
 * ]
 *
 * Time complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
 * Space complexity: O(M), where M is the number of nodes in the last level
 * of the tree, which is 2^logN.
 *
 * Explanation: just use a queue to save each level. Since the exercise is
 * asking for the answer as a vector of vectors, where each inner vector is
 * a level, we need an auxiliary to save all the nodes in a level without
 * interfering with the nodes that are already in the queue and that are part
 * of the same level. In the end we replace the main queue with the auxiliary
 * queue. In other words, process a level and in another queue save all the
 * children of this level, then, after processing this level, replace the main
 * queue with the auxiliary queue with all children because they are the next
 * level.
