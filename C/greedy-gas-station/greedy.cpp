/**
 * There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at
 * station i is gas[i]. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs
 * cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1). You begin
 * the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
 *
 * Return the minimum starting gas stationâ€™s index if you can travel around
 * the circuit once, otherwise return -1.
 * 
 * Note 1: You can only travel in one direction.
 * i to i + 1, i + 2, ... n - 1, 0, 1..
 * Note 2: Completing the circuit means starting at i and ending up at i again.
 * 
 * Example:
 * Given,
 * Gas: [1, 2]
 * Cost: [2, 1]
 * Output: 1 
 * 
 * If you start from index 0, you can fill in gas[0] = 1 amount of gas. Now your
 * tank has 1 unit of gas. But you need cost[0] = 2 gas to travel to station 1. 
 * If you start from index 1, you can fill in gas[1] = 2 amount of gas. Now your
 * tank has 2 units of gas. You need cost[1] = 1 gas to get to station 0. So,
 * you travel to station 0 and still have 1 unit of gas left over. You fill in
 * gas[0] = 1 unit of additional gas, making your current gas = 2. It costs you
 * cost[0] = 2 to get to station 1, which you do and complete the circuit.
 *
 * Time complexity: O(N), where N is the size of the arrays.
 * Space complexity: O(1).
 *
 * Explanation: think about the fuel tank, while it is positive you can keep
 * adding stations because even if there are negative pumps in your way when
 * you find a positive pump you still would end up with more fuel than if you
 * have started at this just found positive pump (of course, right? because you
 * are adding the left fuel in your tank to this positive number). Now, what
 * happens when you tank becomes negative? Well, this means no pump before this
 * pump that just made your tank negative will be able to complete the trip.
 * So, when your tank becomes negative, just restart it to zero and try to
 * complete the trip from the next pump. In other words, the only possible pumps
 * to fulfill the task are the ones that follow a pump that is making your
 * tank negative.
